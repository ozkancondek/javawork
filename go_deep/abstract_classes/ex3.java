/*
Write a Java program to create an abstract 
class BankAccount with abstract methods deposit() 
and withdraw(). Create subclasses: SavingsAccount 
and CurrentAccount that extend the BankAccount class and implement
the respective methods to handle deposits
and withdrawals for each account type.



In the following code, the BankAccount class is an
abstract class with an abstract deposit() method and
an abstract withdraw() method. It also has a private 
instance variable balance of type double and corresponding
getter and setter methods. The SavingsAccount class and the 
CurrentAccount class are the subclasses that extend the BankAccount class.
They implement the deposit() and withdraw() methods
based on the specific rules for each account type.
