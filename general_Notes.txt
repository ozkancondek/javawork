=> How works java code
    Java Code >JDK> ByteCode > JRE > JVM (windows or mac or linux)
    JDK = Java Development(includes jre and jvm) Kit JRE = Java Runtime Environment(libraries) JVM = Java Virtual Amchine (write one time use everywhere)

=> Break and continue are statement not an expression. Staement consist of expressions. Thats why u cant use it in ternary.
